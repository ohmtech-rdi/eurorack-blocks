# Setting up the Environment

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following requirements before starting:

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/download)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on macOS X
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) on macOS X
- [FAUST](https://faust.grame.fr/downloads/)

You then only need minimum knowledge on how the terminal works to get going.


## Setting up FAUST

FAUST comes with some programs, but also its headers, and it should be configured so
that FAUST headers are available to the development environment.

In general it is best to install it with your package manager. This will make sure that both
the FAUST programs and development environment are correctly installed.

This is typically done like this on macOS:

```
brew install faust
```

or on Linux:

```
sudo apt-get install faust
```


## Cloning

Then, clone the repository. This will create a `eurorack-blocks` directory **into the current working directory**, with all dependencies.


```shell-session
~$ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks.git
~$ cd eurorack-blocks
~/eurorack-blocks$
```


## Setting up

Install by running the script below:

```shell-session
~/eurorack-blocks$ ./build-system/install.py
```

This will add the `erbb` script to your `PATH`.

```shell-session
~/eurorack-blocks$ erbb setup
```

This will install all the needed dependencies. You would typically re-run this command when
upgrading `eurorack-blocks`.

In particular, this will install VCV Rack and Kicad. Don't worry if you already have installed those
applications! The setup script won't overwrite your installation.

You can now start to use `eurorack-blocks` with FAUST ðŸŽ‰


## Testing a Sample

Let's test a sample. We'll use the FAUST sample.

```shell-session
~/eurorack-blocks$ cd samples/faust
~/eurorack-blocks/samples/faust$ erbb configure
```

If you inspect the `faust` folder, it now contains an `artifacts` directory, with a lot of files.

```

## Building in Xcode

If you are using Xcode, a `project_vcvrack.xcodeproj` has been created,
which is the project to use to develop and test in the VCV Rack simulator.

This will open the project in Xcode:

```shell-session
~/eurorack-blocks/samples/faust$ open artifacts/project_vcvrack.xcodeproj
```

Press {guilabel}`âŒ˜B` to build.

The build process will output the VCV Rack module in the `Rack/plugins-v1` folder.

## Building from the command line

Alternatively, you can build the VCV Rack module using the command line.

```shell-session
~/eurorack-blocks/samples/faust$ erbb build simulator
Build settings from command line:
    SYMROOT = /Users/raf/dev/eurorack-blocks/samples/faust/artifacts/build
...
** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
```

The build process will output the VCV Rack module in the `Rack/plugins-v1` folder.

## Testing in VCV Rack

Now run VCV Rack, and the `Faust` module will appear in the library when right-clicking
in the rack empty space.

```{important}
Before starting to play with it, make sure to setup your audio device,
and set the sample rate to 48kHz!
This requirement will be explained later in the tutorial.
