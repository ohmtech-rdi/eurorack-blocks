# What You Need

You need a few tools to assemble the kit:

- A spool of solder,
- A temperature-controlled soldering iron,
- A wire cutter,
- A rubber band, or ideally our dedicated [soldering jig](https://www.shapeways.com/product/5YWPBCD6Z/kivu12-soldering-jig-clearance-125).


## Solder Spool

The spool of solder should have the following characteristics:
- Diameter: 0.5 mm / 0.020 inch
- 100% halogen-free, lead-free (RoHS Compliant) wire
- No-clean flux core

We typically use the [`WSW SC L0 0,5mm, 500g, SN0,7CU3,5%` from Weller](https://www.weller-tools.com/us/en/industrial-soldering/products/soldering-wire/wsw-sc-l0-05mm-500g-sn07cu35) pictured here.
It's a big spool and quite expensive (500g is quite a lot as well, probably for a lifetime),
but it's the easiest lead-free solder we found.


## Soldering Iron

To solder properly, a temperature-controlled soldering iron is crucial:

- Can deliver around 400°C/750°F for lead-free solder,
- ESD-safe.

We typically use the [HAKKO FX888D](https://www.hakko.com/english/products/hakko_fx888d.html) pictured here,
together with their [T18/D16 Chisel Soldering Tip](https://www.hakko.com/english/products/hakko_fx888d_tips.html).
This gives you a lot of heat transfer when soldering pin headers.


## Wire Cutter

A good wire cutter, that you exclusively use for electronics, is a must.
It needs to be thin and sharp on the nose, to access small spaces.
Any wire cutter will probably do the job properly, if its end shouts "I'm done for precision cutting". 

We typically use the [Techspray Plato Shear Cutter](https://www.techspray.com/platoshear-cutter-5).


## Other Equipments

Of course the gear listed above can be expensive and you don't really need to make such an
investment to start, so we included the bare minimum specifications you are looking for.

There is much more you can buy to ease soldering if your budget permits it:
- If you are working in a closed environment with not much air circulation, a fume extractor
   is something you will want to look into,
- Some safety glasses to protect your eyes,
- A silicon soldering mat to avoid burning your beloved desk,
- An Anti-static ESD wrist strap band to avoid damaging ESD sensitive parts.

Now that you are all set up, let's move on to soldering the ERB Starter Kit!
