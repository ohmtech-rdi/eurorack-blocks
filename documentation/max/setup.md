# Setting up the Environment

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following requirements before starting.
You then only need minimum knowledge on how the terminal works to get going.

### All platforms

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/download)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/Rack)
- [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max)

### macOS

- macOS at least version 10.15 (Catalina)
- The [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager
- The [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) IDE and build environment

### Windows

- Windows at least version 10
- The [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download) shell
- The [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) package manager
- The [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org) software distribution and building platform

All commands on Windows are expecting the use of Git Bash.
They are not compatible with Cmd or PowerShell.

Your Max installation **needs to have a valid authorization** for `gen~` code to be exported,
on which Eurorack-blocks relies.


## What is Gen?

As [described](https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/vignettes/gen_topic) by Cycling '74:

```{epigraph}
_Gen is an extension of the Max patching environment that converts what you build visually
into efficient compiled code as you go. Not only does it extend the capabilities of Max,
but Gen code can be used outside of Max, with Code Export.
Gen includes the gen~ object for audio, [...].
Use Gen if you want to make efficient audio [...] processes at a very low level and get immediate feedback._
```

Eurorack-blocks's Max Integration is using Gen exported code to build your module for
both the simulator in VCV Rack and your firmware running on the Daisy platform.


## Licensing

Eurorack-blocks has a very permissive [license](https://github.com/ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks/blob/poc-max-integration/LICENSE)
that allows commercial use, modifications, distribution and private use,
as long  as you follow the license requirements.

However, the use of Max-generated code follows a different license,
that you need to follow as well.
Don't worry, if you are a hobbyist and don't plan to make any commercial use,
still read the license to be aware of it in the future,
or check your understanding of commercial-use in the license context, and just go on.
However if you plan to do commercial use of your module using Max-generated code,
you need to comply to Cycling '74's license and read their license carefully.

This license is available in the `artifacts` folder that get generated the first time you use
Eurorack-blocks to build the simulator from the patcher. It will generate a `module_max.h`
file which contains the Gen Licensing agreement at the very top of the file.
The terms of this license might change depending on your Max version, so make sure
to read it again when you upgrade. For example, the license for Max 7.2.5 is not the
same as the one for 7.3.

Additionally, Cycling '74 provides a FAQ if you need more details, that you can read
[here](https://support.cycling74.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050779193-Gen-Code-Export-Licensing-FAQ).
Finally if you have still more questions, please don't hesitate to contact
[licensing@cycling74.com](mailto:licensing@cycling74.com). They won't bite you!


## Cloning

First, clone the repository. This will create a `eurorack-blocks` directory **into the current working directory**, with all dependencies.


```shell-session
~$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks.git
~$ cd eurorack-blocks
~/eurorack-blocks$
```


## Setting up

Install by running the script below:

```shell-session
~/eurorack-blocks$ ./build-system/install.py
```

This will add the `erbb` script to your `PATH`, but the `PATH` will be set only for new terminals.
You can either close your current terminal and open a new one, or source the `erbb` environment
explicitly into your current shell session:

```shell-session
~/eurorack-blocks$ source ./build-system/init.sh
```

Then:

```shell-session
~/eurorack-blocks$ erbb setup
```

This will install all the needed dependencies. You would typically re-run this command when
upgrading `eurorack-blocks`.
If you prefer to install everything manually, just navigate the `erbb` Python script
to the `setup` function to see what get installed and how, depending on your platform.


## Adding the Eurorack-blocks Max package

You can add the Max package contained in Eurorack-blocks directly to Max, by making
a symbolic link to it in your Max packages directory.

```shell-session
~/eurorack-blocks$ cd max
~/eurorack-blocks/max$ ln -s "$(pwd)/Eurorack-blocks" ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Packages/Eurorack-blocks
```

Relaunch Max if it was opened already, and you can now use `eurorack-blocks`  with Max ðŸŽ‰


## Testing a Sample

Let's test a sample. We'll use the Reverb sample in `eurorack-blocks/max/reverb`.
Open the `Reverb.maxpat` file. If everything is correctly installed, it should look like that:

```{image} setup-maxpat.png
:width: 100%
:align: center
```

Now save your patch: this will automatically build the Reverb,
and put the VCV Rack simulator module in the `Rack2/plugins` folder, ready to be used!


## Testing in VCV Rack

Now run VCV Rack, and the `Reverb` module will appear in the library when right-clicking
in the rack empty space.

```{image} setup-rack.png
:width: 100%
:align: center
```

```{important}
Before starting to play with it, make sure to setup your audio device,
and set the sample rate to 48kHz!
This requirement will be explained later in the tutorial.
```

```{image} setup-rack-audio.png
:align: center
```


## Building the Firmware

Should you want to order the real Reverb Eurorack module, but still want to change its firmware,
to add some tweaks to it,
you can simply do that by building the firmware and uploading it to your Eurorack module
the following way. Make sure to connect your Eurorack module to a USB port on your computer.

```shell-session
~/eurorack-blocks$ cd max/reverb
~/eurorack-blocks/max/reverb/$ erbb configure
~/eurorack-blocks/max/reverb/$ erbb build
mkdir Release
ACTION Daisy
...

~/eurorack-blocks/max/reverb/$ erbb install dfu
Enter the system bootloader by holding the BOOT button down,
and then pressing, and releasing the RESET button.
Press Enter to continue...
...
```

That's it! You can now enjoy this sample into a real Eurorack system with all your other modules!
