# Integrating with Max

Now that we've seen how to make a simple module with a knob and some audio inputs and
outputs, let's continue with all that is possible in Eurorack-blocks. There is a lot of different
controls you can use on your front panel, and this list will grow!
Mapping those controls to your gen patch is quick, and you have very little to know.
Actually, you already know most of it.

First, we will have a quick look at erbui, a simple language to describe your Eurorack module
front panel. We plan to make a GUI editor (coming soon), but for now you need to use this
language. And even if you are using the GUI editor, it might be handy to make quickly
some touch-ups.

Second, we will see how to map the inputs and outputs of your gen patch to the inputs and
outputs on your module front panel. You already know most of it with the previous tutorial.
We just need know to talk about CV out and LEDs for example, but the principle are the same.
We will talk also about how to nicely map for example a knob that is supposed to map to
a frequency.

Finally, we will see how to use samples into your gen patch. It's quite simple too, and we
have another language for that, erbb, which describes what sources and resources you
use and where they are.


## Quick Look at Erbui 

We will go quickly on this part, as we plan to make a GUI editor (coming soon). With the
GUI editor, learning `erbui` becomes quite superfluous.

`erbui` is a declarative domain specific language used to describe a module user interface.

It is mostly a collection of `control` elements, with each `control` representing a physical
piece of hardware on the panel. For example you can have a control for a pot and its knob,
a control for a button, but also a control for gate inputs and outputs, CV inputs and outputs,
audio inputs and outputs, or even LEDs with either one or multiple colors.

### Position and style

Every `control` as at least a `position` and `style` attributes, for example:

```{code-block} erbui
---
emphasize-lines: 2, 3
---
control sync_button Button {
   position 2hp, 75.3mm
   style ck.d6r.black
}
```

The first argument of the `position`,
`2hp` expresses the distance between the **left** side of the board to the center of the control,
on the horizontal axis.
Similarly, `75.3mm`, expresses the distance between the **top** side of the board to the center of the control,
on the vertical axis.

Those distances always come with a unit, like `hp`, `mm` or `cm`.
A `hp` is the [Doepfer defined](https://doepfer.de/a100_man/a100m_e.htm)
Eurorack HP distance, which defines 1HP = 5.08mm.

The only argument of `style`, `ck.d6r.black`, defines the hardware component to use.
Here, `ck.d6r.black` denotes the
[C&K D6 series](https://www.ckswitches.com/products/switches/product-details/Keyswitch/D6/),
variant R (round button), in black color.

The `style` is dependent on the control type, here `Button`. For each control type, you can
visit its control reference, which lists the available styles. For example [here is the control
reference for `Button`](../controls/Button). 

### Label

```{image} ui-label.png
:align: right
```

An optional `label` can be added to the control. This will be shown on the front panel, for example:

```{code-block} erbui
---
emphasize-lines: 4
---
control freq_pot Pot {
   position 6hp, 34mm
   style rogan.6ps
   label "FREQ"
}
```

This will place the label automatically below the pot, while taking into account here the
size of the knob attached to the pot.

The default label positioning is dependent on the parent control. For example for the jack
connectors, the default placement label placement will be done on the top of the control.

```{image} ui-label-positioning.png
:align: right
```

The label positioning can be customized, and even multiple labels can be associated to
the same control, for example:

```{code-block} erbui
---
emphasize-lines: 5, 6
---
control mute_hp Switch {
   position 6hp, 62mm
   style dailywell.2ms1
   rotation 90°ccw
   label "MUTE" { positioning left }
   label "HP" { positioning right }
}
```

That's it. This is mostly what you need to know. If you are adventurous, you may want
to read the [Erbui grammar](../erbui/grammar)!


## Mapping Names

As you may have seen, the main concept to map a gen patch input or output to a front panel
control is to give them the same name. Depending on the type of the control, there are
slightly different boxes to use in your gen patcher.
Let's go through them now:

### Audio inputs

[`AudioIn`](../controls/AudioIn) on your panel is mapped to {guilabel}`in <n>` in your patcher
where `<n>` is the index of the input, starting from one. The index follow the order of
declaration in your Erbui file, so if you have the following file:

```{code-block} erbui
control audio_in_left AudioIn {
   position 2hp, 111mm
   style thonk.pj398sm.knurled
   label "IN L"
}

control audio_in_right AudioIn {
   position 4.66hp, 111mm
   style thonk.pj398sm.knurled
   label "IN R"
}
```

Then {guilabel}`in 1` would map to `audio_in_left` and {guilabel}`in 2` to `audio_in_right`.
Note that the control names are just ignored in the gen patcher, just the order counts.
Yet, it is still important to have the same number of audio inputs in both files. If this is not the case,
the Erbui transpiler will report an error.

One neat thing you can do with audio inputs, is to cascade them. For example using the
previous example, you might want your right audio input to take the left audio input, if the
right audio input is not connected. You can do this simply using the `cascade` keyword:

```{code-block} erbui
---
emphasize-lines: 5
---
control audio_in_left AudioIn {
   position 2hp, 111mm
   style thonk.pj398sm.knurled
   label "IN L"
   cascade audio_in_right
}

control audio_in_right AudioIn {
   position 4.66hp, 111mm
   style thonk.pj398sm.knurled
   label "IN R"
}
```

### Audio outputs

[`AudioOut`](../controls/AudioOut) on your panel is mapped to {guilabel}`out <n>` in your patcher
where `<n>` is the index of the output, starting from one. The index follow the order of
declaration in your Erbui file, so if you have the following file:

```{code-block} erbui
control audio_out_left AudioOut {
   position 7.33hp, 111mm
   style thonk.pj398sm.knurled
   label "OUT L"
}

control audio_out_right AudioOut {
   position 10hp, 111mm
   style thonk.pj398sm.knurled
   label "OUT R"
}
```

Then {guilabel}`out 1` would map to `audio_out_left` and {guilabel}`out 2` to `audio_out_right`.
Note that the control names are just ignored in the gen patcher, just the order counts.
Yet, it is still important to have the same number of audio outputs in both files. If this is not the case,
the Erbui transpiler will report an error.

### Input controls

[`CvIn`](../controls/CvIn), [`GateIn`](../controls/GateIn), [`Button`](../controls/Button),
[`Pot`](../controls/Pot), [`Switch`](../controls/Switch) and [`Trim`](../controls/Trim) on
your panel are all mapped to {guilabel}`param <name>` in your patcher
where `<name>` is the name of the control in your Erbui file.
So if you have a {guilabel}`param freq` box in your gen patch, then you will need a
`control freq` definition in your Erbui file.

The mapping also supports gen `param` attributes `@min` and `@max`.

[`GateIn`](../controls/GateIn) and  [`Button`](../controls/Button) represent on or off values
that are mapped to the minimum and maximum value of the gen parameter, respectively.

In the case of the [`Switch`](../controls/Switch), the intermediate value is mapped to the
average between the minimum and maximum of the gen parameter.

### Output controls

[`CvOut`](../controls/CvOut), [`GateOut`](../controls/GateOut), [`Led`](../controls/Led),
[`LedBi`](../controls/LedBi) and [`LedRgb`](../controls/LedRgb) on
your panel are all mapped to {guilabel}`history <name>` in your patcher
where `<name>` is the name of the control in your Erbui file.

[`LedBi`](../controls/LedBi) and [`LedRgb`](../controls/LedRgb) are a bit special though,
because they are not represented by one scalar value, but 2 for the dichromatic LED
(one for each component, usually red and green), and 3 for the Rgb LED (one for each
primary colors).
In this case you need to address the specific property to set in the control, by appending
an underscore `_` and the name of the property.
For example, if you have the following Erbui description:

```{code-block} erbui
control state_led LedBi {
   position 7.33hp, 85mm
   style led.3mm.green_red
}
```

To set the value of the red portion of the led, you would use {guilabel}`history state_led_r`
and similarly for the green portion, {guilabel}`history state_led_g`.

That's it, this is all you need to know about how to map your front panel controls to your
gen patch. Eurorack-blocks takes care of all the rest!


## Mapping Values

Now that we know how to map a name, we need to know how to map the value associated
to that name. It's quite easy indeed.

In Erbui, all values are unipolar, meaning they range from 0 to 1. But you can make them
bipolar, so that when the knob is at the middle, it is equivalent to 0. This is only handy
when using the simulator, as the knob will be centered by default. You specify a bipolar
control using its `mode`. You typically use this for a trim pot that used as an
"attenuverter":

```{code-block} erbui
---
emphasize-lines: 2
---
control feedback_trim Trim {
   mode bipolar
   position 7.33hp, 80.8mm
   style songhuei.9mm
   label "–/+" { positioning top }
}
```

On the gen patch side, you just need to specify a minimum and maximum value, and
Eurorack-blocks will map it accordingly. The bipolar mode has no effect on that.
If your pot is on the most-left side of its angular rotation, the value of a parameter will
be the `@min` value of your gen `param` box, 0 by default if you didn't specify it.
Similarly, if your pot is on the most-right side of its angular rotation, the value of a parameter will
be the `@max` value of your gen `param` box, 1 by default if you didn't specify it.

Though it is usually easier to keep the default minimum and maximum values to 0 and 1 respectively,
which allows you to scale the param nicely to accomodate for human perception.
For example, to scale a frequency pot,
you can use the box {guilabel}`expr out1 = 10 * pow (22000/10, in1)`
which will output a value of 10Hz when the pot is on the most-left side,
22kHz when the pot is on the most-right side,
while following a natural perceptual progression for the values in between.


## Using Samples

The last point to see is how to use samples in your patch, and Eurorack-blocks makes this
task very easy!
The samples are defined in the build-system file together with your source code — here
just your max patch.
You just need to define an audio sample, give it a name and the file path relative to
your erbb file.

```{important}
Adding a sample is done in your `.erbb` file, **not** the `.erbui` file!
```

```{code-block} erbb
---
emphasize-lines: 7-9
---
module Kick {
   sources {
      file "Kick.erbui"
      file "Kick.maxpat"
   }
   
   resources {
      data kick AudioSample { file "kick.wav" }
   }
}
```

You just need to add a `resources` scope and add as many — reasonably though! for a
reason we will see below — `data` declaration as you have samples.

Then you can simply add the sample in your gen patch as a {guilabel}`data <name>` box, where,
you guessed it, `<name>` is the name of the `data` in the Erbb file, so for example
{guilabel}`data kick` in the example above. That's it!

You might now think, but where are those samples stored? For both the simulator and
the firmware, this is stored in the program itself.
For your module running in the simulator using VCV Rack, this is not a big issue. The files
can be quite large but will run happily. If you put large files though, you will see that building
the module will take more time.
Though, for the final firmware, things are not so ideal. We have 2 choices here.

Either store the program in the so-called FLASH memory, which is 128K, so there is really
not much room. But if you have a few wave tables to store, that might make it.

If you are going passed this point, we can store it in another memory, called the QSPI
memory, which has a more ample 8MB to work with. So you can't really store a full song,
but if it's for drum samples and the like, that should totally work.
To use this memory instead you need to add a `section qspi` in your Erbb file:

```{code-block} erbb
---
emphasize-lines: 2
---
module Drum {
   section qspi

   sources {
      file "Drum.erbui"
      file "Drum.maxpat"
   }
   
   resources {
      data kick AudioSample { file "kicks/kick_aba.wav" }
      data kick2 AudioSample { file "kicks/kick_ece.wav" }
      data hat1 AudioSample { file "hihats/hat_01.wav" }
      data hat2 AudioSample { file "hihats/hat_02.wav" }
      data ride AudioSample { file "rides/ride.wav" }
   }
}
```

Uploading the firmware is then a bit different, but this whole process is explained in great details in
"{doc}`/guides/kick`".

That's it! This is all you ever wanted to know about Eurorack-blocks and Max integration.
Happy patching 🎉
