# Selecting the Environment


Time to set up the Eurorack-blocks environment!

We support a lot of different environment, wether you are using macOS, Windows or Linux,
or are using C++, Max or Faust.

Making a smooth installation was harder to achieve, because of the cardinality of possible
configurations. We've tried to best to give you a effortless user experience.
If you have any error, make sure to browse our troubleshootin section (coming soon),
or to [open a new issue](https://github.com/ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks/issues/new) to
tell us what went wrong, so we can help you.


## macOS

If you are a macOS user, please choose below the ecosystem you wish to install.

- [C++ with Xcode](./macos-cpp-xcode.md)

If you want to do C++ but are not sure what to choose, we would advise Xcode as this
gives the best debugging experience. But you can always change your mind later anyway.

If you are a Linux user, please choose below the ecosystem you wish to install:
