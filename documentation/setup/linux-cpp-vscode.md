# C++ on Linux with Visual Studio Code


## Requirements

```{note}
Ubuntu Focal (20.04) or later is recommended.
```

Before we can setup Eurorack-blocks, we will need to have on your system:

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/download)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [VCV Rack at least version 2.4](https://vcvrack.com/Rack)

If you are a developer, there is a chance that most of them are installed already.

Experienced developers might already have one (or multiple!) versions of Python installed.
For Eurorack-blocks, please use at least Python 3.7.

```{note}
Please use the copy button on the top right corner of the following code blocks
to copy/paste the commands in your terminal.
```

Typically on Ubuntu, you would use `apt` to install `git` and `python3`.

Make sure everything is up-to-date: 

```{code-block} shell-session
MyPC:~ $ sudo apt-get update
```

To install Git, run the following command:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyPC:~ $ sudo apt-get install git-all
```

To install Python 3, run the following command:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyPC:~ $ sudo apt-get install python3
```

You can check your installation by trying the following commands, and checking it doesn't
return an error or something else than it version. Versions are shown here for a concrete
example, they might be different on your computer.

```{code-block} shell-session
MyPC:~ $ git --version
git version 2.25.1
```

```{code-block} shell-session
MyPC:~ $ python3 --version
Python 3.8.2
```


## Cloning

Clone the repository. This will create a `eurorack-blocks` directory **into the current working directory**, with all dependencies.

```{code-block} shell-session
MyPC:~ $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks.git
```

Will typically output:

```{code-block} shell-session
Cloning into 'eurorack-blocks'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 14327, done.
...
Submodule path 'submodules/libDaisy/tests/googletest': checked out 'f5e592d8ee5ffb1d9af5be7f715ce3576b8bf9c4'
Submodule path 'submodules/vcv-rack-sdk': checked out '91fd742827c04d36ba9b0e5e179571e393682326'
```


## Setting up

First change the current directory to `eurorack-blocks`:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyPC:~ $ cd eurorack-blocks
```

Then install by running the script below:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyPC:~/eurorack-blocks $ ./build-system/install.py
```

This will add the `erbb` script to your `PATH`, but the `PATH` will be set only for new terminals.
You can either close your current terminal and open a new one, or source the `erbb` environment
explicitly into your current shell session:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyPC:~/eurorack-blocks $ source ./build-system/init.sh
```

Then:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyPC:~/eurorack-blocks $ erbb setup --with-apt --with-vscode-support
```

This will take a bit of time depending on your Internet connection.

`erbb setup` by itself is installing dependencies internally without modifying anything on
your system. If you delete the `eurorack-blocks` folder, boom, everything is gone.

The additional options, usually starting with `--with` do change your system. For example
here we install the needed toolchain using `apt` and syntax highlighting for the custom languages
that Eurorack-blocks use.

You might have a different package manager (for example `dnf` on Fedora), that is not supported
natively in Eurorack-blocks, or you just want to make sure that Eurorack-blocks doesn't install
programs without you knowing exactly what is installed.

If you want to see exactly what it does, navigate to `build-system/scripts/erbb`,
and look at the Linux section in the `setup` function.

You can now start to use `eurorack-blocks` ðŸŽ‰


## Testing a Sample

Let's test a sample. We'll use the Drop sample.

```{code-block} shell-session
MyPC:~/eurorack-blocks $ cd samples/drop
MyPC:~/eurorack-blocks/samples/drop $ erbb configure
```

If you inspect the `drop` folder, it now contains an `artifacts` directory, with some folders and files.

```{image} macos-configure.png
:width: 100%
:align: center
```

The `Drop.code-workspace` is a VS Code workspace, to develop, build and debug the
firmware and the simulator module on Linux.
Let's open it:

```{image} macos-cpp-vscode-workspace.png
:width: 100%
:align: center
```

To debug your module:

- Choose the `Run & Debug` tab in the side bar,
- Select the target you want to debug,
   - `Launch Firmware Release` will debug the firmware in Release configuration on the connected Daisy using a STLink probe with OpenOCD,
   - `Launch Firmware Debug` will debug the firmware in Debug configuration on the connected Daisy using a STLink probe with OpenOCD,
   - `Launch Simulator Debug` will debug your module with the simulator in VCV Rack,
- Hit the green play button to start debugging.

## Testing in VCV Rack

In VCV Rack the `Drop` module will appear in the library when right-clicking in the rack empty space.

```{image} vcvrack-drop.png
:width: 100%
:align: center
```

```{important}
Before starting to play with it, make sure to setup your audio device,
and set the sample rate to 48kHz!
This requirement will be explained later in the tutorial.
```

```


## Testing in your Eurorack System

If you bougth the Eurorack-blocks Starter Kit, it comes with the Drop module, and you should
have already assembled it by now.

You can build the firmware by running:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyPC:~/eurorack-blocks/samples/drop $ erbb build firmware
BUILD libDaisy
mkdir Release
ACTION UI
ACTION Daisy
...
LINK Release/Drop.elf

OBJCOPY Release/Drop.bin
OBJCOPY Release/Drop.hex
```

To install the firmware, that we previously built in the section above:
- Connect the same USB cable that you used for installing the Frohmager firmware,
- Run the following command and follow the on-screen instructions:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyPC:~/eurorack-blocks/samples/drop $ erbb install firmware
Enter the system bootloader by holding the BOOT button down,
and then pressing, and releasing the RESET button.
Press Enter to continue...
...
```

```

Note that if you bought a STLink V3 Mini
for example from [Electro-smith](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/stlink-v3mini),
you can use it to program the Daisy Patch Submodule.
It has the advantage to be more convenient, as:
- It is typically faster than using the USB port on the Daisy Patch Submodule,
- You don't need to remove your module from your base to press those BOOT and RESET
   button,
- It can be also used to debug the firmware in the event a bug in the firmware doesn't appear
   in the simulator.

The `install` command will automatically select the STLink V3 Mini to install the firmware
if it is plugged on your computer.

Have fun!

Maybe now is a good time to head over to **{doc}`/guides/first`** to learn more about the
Eurorack-blocks' C++ framework.
