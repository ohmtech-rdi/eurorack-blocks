# C++ on macOS with Visual Studio Code


## Requirements

```{note}
macOS 10.15 (Catalina) has limited support. Some tools do not always work
properly, so macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later is recommended.
```

Before we can setup Eurorack-blocks, we will need to have on your system:

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/download)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [VCV Rack at least version 2.4](https://vcvrack.com/Rack)

If you are a developer, there is a chance that most of them are installed already.

In all cases, please make sure that the Python in use is not the one from Xcode.
You can verify this by typing `which python3` in the Terminal and looking for the mention
of `Xcode` in the returned path. If this command didn't return anything, then you do not
have Python installed, and please use the link above to install it.

Experienced developers might already have one (or multiple!) versions of Python installed.
For Eurorack-blocks, please use at least Python 3.7.

```{note}
Please use the copy button on the top right corner of the following code blocks
to copy/paste the commands in your terminal.
```

The Xcode command line tools come already with Xcode, so one option is to install Xcode
as well. If you want to avoid having to install Xcode, you can selectively install the Xcode
command line tools by running:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~ $ xcode-select --install
```

You can check your installation by trying the following commands, and checking it doesn't
return an error or something else than it version. Versions are shown here for a concrete
example, they might be different on your computer.

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~ $ git --version
git version 2.41.0
```

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~ $ python3 --version
Python 3.11.4
```

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~ $ xcodebuild -version
Xcode 13.4
Build version 13F17a
```

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~ $ which python3
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3
```
Note that `Xcode` doesn't appear in the above path.


## Cloning

Clone the repository. This will create a `eurorack-blocks` directory **into the current working directory**, with all dependencies.

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~ $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks.git
```

Will typically output:

```{code-block} shell-session
Cloning into 'eurorack-blocks'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 14327, done.
...
Submodule path 'submodules/libDaisy/tests/googletest': checked out 'f5e592d8ee5ffb1d9af5be7f715ce3576b8bf9c4'
Submodule path 'submodules/vcv-rack-sdk': checked out '91fd742827c04d36ba9b0e5e179571e393682326'
```


## Setting up

First change the current directory to `eurorack-blocks`:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~ $ cd eurorack-blocks
```

Then install by running the script below:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~/eurorack-blocks $ ./build-system/install.py
```

This will add the `erbb` script to your `PATH`, but the `PATH` will be set only for new terminals.
You can either close your current terminal and open a new one, or source the `erbb` environment
explicitly into your current shell session:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~/eurorack-blocks $ source ./build-system/init.sh
```

Then:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~/eurorack-blocks $ erbb setup --with-vscode-support
```

This will take a bit of time depending on your Internet connection.

`erbb setup` by itself is installing dependencies internally without modifying anything on
your system. If you delete the `eurorack-blocks` folder, boom, everything is gone.

The additional options, usually starting with `--with` do change your system. For example
here we install the syntax highlighting for the custom languages that Eurorack-blocks use,
but this is pretty harmless.

If you want to see exactly what it does and copy, navigate to `build-system/setup/__init__.py`,
and look at the `install_vscode_support` function.

You can now start to use `eurorack-blocks` ðŸŽ‰


## Testing a Sample

Let's test a sample. We'll use the Drop sample.

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~/eurorack-blocks $ cd samples/drop
MyMac:~/eurorack-blocks/samples/drop $ erbb configure
```

If you inspect the `drop` folder, it now contains an `artifacts` directory, with some folders and files.

```{image} macos-configure.png
:width: 100%
:align: center
```

The `Drop.code-workspace` is a VS Code workspace, to develop, build and debug the
firmware and the simulator module on macOS.
Let's open it:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~/eurorack-blocks/samples/drop$ open artifacts/Drop.code-workspace
```

```{image} macos-cpp-vscode-workspace.png
:width: 100%
:align: center
```

To debug your module:

- Choose the `Run & Debug` tab in the side bar,
- Select the target you want to debug,
   - `Launch Firmware Release` will debug the firmware in Release configuration on the connected Daisy using a STLink probe with OpenOCD,
   - `Launch Firmware Debug` will debug the firmware in Debug configuration on the connected Daisy using a STLink probe with OpenOCD,
   - `Launch Simulator Debug` will debug your module with the simulator in VCV Rack,
- Hit the green play button to start debugging.

## Testing in VCV Rack

In VCV Rack the `Drop` module will appear in the library when right-clicking in the rack empty space.

```{image} vcvrack-drop.png
:width: 100%
:align: center
```

```{important}
Before starting to play with it, make sure to setup your audio device,
and set the sample rate to 48kHz!
This requirement will be explained later in the tutorial.
```

```


## Testing in your Eurorack System

If you bougth the Eurorack-blocks Starter Kit, it comes with the Drop module, and you should
have already assembled it by now.

You can build the firmware by running:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~/eurorack-blocks/samples/drop $ erbb build firmware
BUILD libDaisy
mkdir Release
ACTION UI
ACTION Daisy
...
LINK Release/Drop.elf

OBJCOPY Release/Drop.bin
OBJCOPY Release/Drop.hex
```

To install the firmware, that we previously built in the section above:
- Connect the same USB cable that you used for installing the Frohmager firmware,
- Run the following command and follow the on-screen instructions:

```{code-block} shell-session
MyMac:~/eurorack-blocks/samples/drop $ erbb install firmware
Enter the system bootloader by holding the BOOT button down,
and then pressing, and releasing the RESET button.
Press Enter to continue...
...
```

```

Note that if you bought a STLink V3 Mini
for example from [Electro-smith](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/stlink-v3mini),
you can use it to program the Daisy Patch Submodule.
It has the advantage to be more convenient, as:
- It is typically faster than using the USB port on the Daisy Patch Submodule,
- You don't need to remove your module from your base to press those BOOT and RESET
   button,
- It can be also used to debug the firmware in the event a bug in the firmware doesn't appear
   in the simulator.

The `install` command will automatically select the STLink V3 Mini to install the firmware
if it is plugged on your computer.

Have fun!

Maybe now is a good time to head over to **{doc}`/guides/first`** to learn more about the
Eurorack-blocks' C++ framework.
