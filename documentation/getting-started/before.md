# Before You Start

Eurorack-blocks is currently in development. Should you choose to use it today, consider
yourself in the essential community of early adopters.


## Your feedback is important!

There is no stupid questions, only incomplete documentation.
Don't be shy and [open an issue](https://github.com/ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks/issues/new).
If the subject is out of scope of Eurorack-blocks, we will try to redirect you to the
relevant documents.

If you prefer to chat live and engage with the community, you can find us on the
[Daisy Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ByHBnMtQTR) in the `#eurorack-blocks` channel.


## Some DIY skills are required for now

On the long term, you will be able to receive your hardware module with absolutely no
soldering skills required.

In the meantime, and provided you bought our Starter Kit, Eurorack-blocks requires only some
basic soldering skills. If you have been soldering audio cables before, you probably already
have what it takes.

If you prefer to not buy our Starter Kit, Eurorack-blocks requires SMD soldering gear and knowledge,
which is more involved. However we made an entire chapter to help you with that, that
you can find in the "DIY Corner".


## Eurorack-blocks is not mature

Eurorack-blocks is a very ambitious project. For this reason we decided to first go wide and
implement the maximum number of features rather than go specific
and have just a few high-quality features, but not enough to build a simple module.

For this reason, API might change, some code might break and your favorite IDE might not
be supported. But don't worry! Those are mostly small details you will get used to.


## Contributors are welcomed!

Eurorack-blocks is maintained by essentially a few individuals which obviously is not enough
given the scope of this project.

If you can help, we will really appreciate it.
Contact us on [Daisy Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/es-daisy/shared_invite/zt-f9cfm1g4-DgdCok1h1Rj4fpX90~IOww)
so we can coordinate the tasks.
