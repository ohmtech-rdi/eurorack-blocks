# Eurorack-blocks: Software to Hardware Prototyping for Eurorack

The Eurorack-blocks project allows to develop your own custom Eurorack module for either prototyping or fun in the comfort of your day-to-day IDE and debugging in a virtual Eurorack environment, and when ready, to auto-magically generate all the needed files to manufacture the Eurorack module for you to use in a real Eurorack modular system.

No embedded system or hardware knowledge needed ü§ó

: You don't need to be an embedded software or hardware engineer to produce a Eurorack module.
   Eurorack-blocks takes care of this so you can focus exclusively on the creative part of your module.

Build an debug in your favorite IDE üíª

: Thanks to the simulator, you can test your module completely in a virtual Eurorack environment, [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com).
   Iterate and refine your module, and think about creating the hardware only later.

Integration with Max and FAUST üîÄ

: You don't need to use C++. Use your favorite audio environment like Max (coming soon) or FAUST (coming soon) to express your ideas quickly.

Enough power to support your wildest ideas üí™

: Eurorack-blocks is using [Daisy Patch Submodule](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/patch-sm),
   a DSP platform for Eurorack synthesizer modules. It features a lightning fast STM32 processor,
   high fidelity stereo audio codec, and enough RAM for 10 minute long buffers
   ‚Äî all with standard signal levels and conditioning for the Eurorack ecosystem.

Open Source ‚ù§Ô∏è

: Our code is [free and open source](https://github.com/ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks) with a very permissive [license](https://github.com/ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks/blob/main/LICENSE).


## Audience

You should be familiar with either C++, Max or FAUST.

You should know how to use a terminal and a shell like `bash`, but their usage are quite limited.

Some knowledge of `git` and a package manager such as `apt` or `brew` is also adviced,
while not strictly necessary.
